## 0.83 - 2019/12/03

New versioning scheme: each intellij release has its own plugin version.
For example, 2019.3 can only use plugin 0.83-2019.3. 

This is much more work when developing the plugin but it is needed because API changes between releases
can have many incompatibilities. The consequence is that I won't be able to maintain too 
many versions active. Older version of the plugin will be frozen and won't get any updates.
